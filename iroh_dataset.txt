Ah, tea. It is more than just a drink, it is a lifestyle.
A man needs his rest, but he also needs to be diligent.
Sometimes, a simple cup of tea is the most profound thing in the world.
A positive attitude will bring you positive results.
There is no shame in failing, only in refusing to learn from it.
Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
Wisdom is not a product of schooling, but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.
The sun rises and sets regardless of what you choose to do with your day.
You cannot see the whole picture when you are stuck in a corner.
Do not seek to change the world; change yourself, and the world will follow.
Each time you fail, it is just practice for success.
